//Name: Ishaan Mittal
//Date: <Jan 20 - Jan 26> 
//Assignment: Culminating 
//Purpose: To make a log in page for library program 


//Code Explnation: 
//This program is an event based program so there is no specfic order this program can run but, in my explanantion I will talk the proceudre between the 2 interfaces, Log-In and Sign Up

//For Login:
//After the initialize compenent the program displays eveyrhting that is needed to start the program, this includes things such as the username text box, labels to help the user, sign up button, and submit 
//Then, once user inputs a value for username and clicks submit, the program checks if it is already in the file and validates the input.
//Once the input is validated, then the user is asked for their password and the username text box dissapears and is replaced by the password text box 
//Then, after the user inputs the password and clicks submit, the program checks if the password matches the username and if so, leads to the next part of the program being the library interface which is a whole sepratre thing 

//For Sign Up:
//After the user clicks sign up, all the labels and buttons from the previous login page are hidden and repalced with the new labels and buttons that work for the sign up part of the program (text boxes don't change however) 
//Then, the user is asked to enter a new username and password 
//Once they input their username and password and click submit the program validates the input and prints error messges accordingly  
//Additionally, for the username the program checks the text file and if the username is arleady in the text file it inform the user that the username is taken, the reason this doesn't happen for password is becuase people can have the same password 
//After the input is validated, the program writes to a text file of accounts, and updates their info so any other time they review this program again their info is saved 
//Laslty, after the File IO the prgram ends and leads to the next part of the project being the library interface 

//(Addition) Back: 
//During the sign up interface there is a new button shown with the text of ">Back" 
//Once clicked it clears the labels and buttons from the sign up page and replaces them with the labels and buttons for the login page
//Basically, it just goes back to the orginal login interface incase the user remebers their log in or accidently clicked sign up 

//In summary, despite having 2 different 'interfaces' for my program the end result is the same which is to lead to the next part of the program and save any user changes made on their library account (logging in, or making a new one)
