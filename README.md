 * Book name, ISBN, availability and rating will be stored in the same file.
 * Checking out a book upon entering or scanning ISBN-13 (user input).
 * User will only be allowed to check-out one book at a time.
 * User will input their preferred return date and time for the book.

 * Rating a book (avg will be taken for official rating for book in file).
 * Returning a book (user input).
 * Program will notify user when they have returned books past the due date.
